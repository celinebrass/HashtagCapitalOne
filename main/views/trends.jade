      h4 What is sentiment analysis?
      p This app uses IBM's Alchemy API to analyze a post's attitude and assign it a value betweem -1 and 1, with one representing a very negative post and 1 representing a very positive post. A least squares regression line (also known as a "line of best fit") for the data is then plotted in order to show trends in the sentiment of posts with the tag "#CapitalOne". Please wait a few seconds for the graph to display.
